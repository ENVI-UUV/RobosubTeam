#Copyright Notes:
* Code primarily reflects the authors of the three.js examples under the MIT License 
"http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shaders_ocean.html"
and
"http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_obj_mtl.html"

* Please Note:
The most heavily borrowed code(that isn't from three.js examples) is actually from the work of an unnamed jsFiddle.net author(previously unattributed user, possibly identified as "WestLangley") who is assumed to be the same stackoverflow user who answered a question about a downward facing camera here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16227714

#Housecleaning
* Almost none of josdirksen's code remains: consider forking the repository, then rolling that fork back to a previous commit such that it accurately reflects the attribution, then sanitizing the remainder of borrowed code. Credit to josdirksen will then be preserved in the README.md.
